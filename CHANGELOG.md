2. [v0.0.2](#v002)

## v0.1.0

The focus of this release was to improve maintainability of the project and adding some new elements.

### Enhancement

1. Use Grunt to build sass (issue #5)

### Bug fixes

## v0.0.2

The focus of this minor release was to convert all px to em so that the framework is responsive-ish.

- You can now control the size of the Kawaii character by changing the font size. The default is 10px.
- Twitter Bootstrap has been used in the example page for responsive layout, but it is not required when using Kawaii framework.
- Since the example is done with Bootstrap, you can be sure that Kawaii framework works with it.
- In the example, you can compare the new responsive Kawaii versus v0.0.1.
